# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates Encapsultion of NFT along with multiple ERC20s. <br/>
- [ NFT + ERC20 ] are encapsulted

- **User** --(owns)--> **NFT**
    - **NFT** --(owns)--> **ERC20 Tokens** <br/>

- Thus NFT ENcap

It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.


Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
